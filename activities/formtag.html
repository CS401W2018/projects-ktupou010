        <h3>The form tag has an "action" attribute. What does it do?</h3>
        <p>The action attribute in a form tag is an attribute specifies where to send the form's data when it is submitted. It can be a URL or a script that processes the data.</p>
        <h3>The form tag has a "method" attribute. What does it do?</h3>
        <p>The method attribute in a form tag is an attribute defines how the form data is sent to the server. The two most common methods are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>GET: Appends the form data to the URL as query parameters.</li>
            <li>POST: Sends the form data in the request body, making it less visible and often used for sensitive information.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is the difference between a "POST" and a "GET"?</h3>
        <p>The GET method appends form data to the URL, making it visible and suitable for small data or search queries, while the POST method sends data in the HTTP request body, ideal for larger or sensitive data as it is not appended to the URL. The main difference lies in visibility, data size, and use cases, with GET for data retrieval and POST for actions that modify the server or involve secure data handling.</p>
        <h3>What are different ways to style your form?</h3>
        <p>There are several ways to style a form to enhance its appearance and usability. CSS layout techniques like flexbox, grid, inline-block, or float can be used to position and align form elements efficiently. Flexbox is particularly popular because it allows for flexible layouts, simplifies responsive design, and requires fewer lines of code. Input fields can be styled with rounded corners, shadows, or customized fonts and colors to match the theme, while hover and focus effects improve interactivity. Grouping elements using fieldsets and legends, along with proper spacing, adds structure, and responsive design through media queries ensures the form adjusts to various screen sizes. Validation indicators like red borders or error messages provide user feedback, and custom buttons can make the form more visually appealing.</p>
        <h3>Why does the professor like to use flex?</h3>
        <p>Because flex is makes css easier and little.</p>
        <h3>What is JavaScript? How did it get its name?</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is a powerful, high-level programming language used primarily to create interactive and dynamic functionalities on websites. It's widely employed for enhancing user experiences by enabling features like animations, form validations, and real-time content updates. Initially called "Mocha," then "LiveScript," it was renamed "JavaScript" as a marketing strategy by Netscape to align with Java's popularity, even though the two languages are distinct and unrelated.</p>
        <h3>What are the two ways you can run JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>In the Browser: JavaScript is executed directly by web browsers like Chrome or Safari and On the Server: Using tools like Node.js, JavaScript can also be run on servers for back-end operations.</p>
        <h3>What was the most popular front-end js library?</h3>
        <p>Most popular front-end JavaScript library in the past: jQuery was widely regarded as the most popular library for many years due to its simplicity in DOM manipulation and event handling.</p>
        <h3>What is the most popular front-end js library today?</h3>
        <p>Most popular front-end JavaScript library today: React.js is currently the leading choice, favored for building scalable and efficient user interfaces.</p>
        <h3>What is AJAX?</h3>
        <p>AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It is a web development technique that allows web pages to send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously, without refreshing the entire page. This makes web applications faster and more user-friendly, as only parts of the page are updated dynamically.</p>
        <h3>Why do you put your JS Code in a separate file?</h3>
        <p>Placing JavaScript code in a separate file offers several advantages: it improves organization by keeping HTML, CSS, and JavaScript separate, making the code easier to manage and read; it ensures reusability, allowing the same JavaScript file to be used across multiple web pages, saving development time; it benefits caching, as browsers can store external JavaScript files to enhance performance for repeat visits; and it boosts maintainability, simplifying updates and debugging by keeping the code modular and separated.</p>
