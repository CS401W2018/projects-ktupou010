        <h3>What you learned about Flex and CSS.</h3>
        <p>Flexbox is a handy CSS tool for arranging items within a container. It makes it easier to create flexible and responsive layouts without complex calculations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Flex Container and Items: The main container (parent) and the items inside it (children).</li>
            <li>Flex Direction: Sets how items are placed in the container (row, column, etc.).</li>
            <li>Justify Content and Align Items: Manages item alignment along the main and cross axes.</li>
            <li>Flex Wrap: Allows items to move to the next line if needed.</li>
            <li>Align Self: Lets individual items align differently from others.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why do you need to have an accessible website? What does that mean?</h3>
        <p>Having an accessible website means making sure everyone, including people with disabilities, can use and navigate it easily. This involves designing websites that are clear and usable for all. It's important because it ensures inclusivity for people with various disabilities, meets legal standards, improves overall user experience, and expands the reach of your content to a broader audience.</p>
