        <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage. With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!</p>
        <h3>Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS.</h3>
        <p>Inline CSS refers to CSS styles written directly in the HTML element using the style attribute. And Embedded CSS refers to CSS styles written within the HTML document using the style tag, usually in the head section. Also External CSS refers to CSS styles written in a separate file with a `.css` extension, which is then linked to the HTML document using the `link` tag.</p>
        <h3>Explain why you should only use external CSS.</h3>
        <p>Using only external CSS is a best practice for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Separation of Concerns: External CSS keeps presentation styles separate from HTML structure and content, making it easier to maintain and update websites.</li>
            <li>Reusability: External CSS files can be linked to multiple HTML documents, allowing for consistent styling across entire websites.</li>
            <li>Flexibility: External CSS makes it easy to switch between different styles or themes by simply swapping the CSS file.</li>
            <li>Scalability: As websites grow, external CSS helps keep styles organized and manageable.</li>
            <li>Cacheability: External CSS files can be cached by browsers, reducing page load times.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is a selector used for?</h3>
        <p>In CSS, a selector is used to target specific HTML elements or groups of elements to apply styles. Selectors identify the elements to which the styles will be applied.</p>
        <p>Types of Selectors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Element Selectors: Target elements by their HTML tag name (e.g., p, h1, img).</li>
            <li>Class Selectors: Target elements with a specific class attribute (e.g., .header, .footer).</li>
            <li>ID Selectors: Target elements with a specific ID attribute (e.g., #header, #footer).</li>
            <li>Attribute Selectors: Target elements with specific attributes or attribute values.</li>
            <li>Pseudo-Class Selectors: Target elements based on their state or position (e.g., :hover, :active, :first-child).</li>
            <li>By using selectors effectively, you c</li>
