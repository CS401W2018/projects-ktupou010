        <h2>What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG?</h2>
        <p>JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is suitable for encoding photos with many colors and smooth transitions, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Photographs of landscapes, portraits, and still-life images</li>
            <li>Images with subtle color gradations and textures</li>
        </ul>
        <p>JPEG uses lossy compression, which discards some data to reduce file size, making it ideal for photos where minor losses in quality are acceptable.</p>
        <h2>What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF?</h2>
        <p>GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is suitable for encoding photos with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Few colors (up to 256)</li>
            <li>Sharp edges and lines</li>
            <li>Text or logos</li>
        </ul>
        <p>GIF uses lossless compression, which preserves all data, making it ideal for images with solid colors, logos, or text.</p>
        <h2>What is unique about the PNG format?</h2>
        <p>PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is unique because it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Uses lossless compression, preserving all data</li>
            <li>Supports transparent backgrounds</li>
            <li>Has better compression than GIF for images with many colors</li>
        </ul>
        <p>PNG is ideal for images with transparent backgrounds, such as logos, icons, or graphics.</p>
        <h2>How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</h2>
        <p>To resize a photo:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the image in photo editing software (e.g., Adobe Photoshop)</li>
            <li>Use the "Image Size" or "Resize" feature to adjust the dimensions</li>
            <li>Choose the desired resolution (e.g., 72 dpi for web) and file format</li>
            <li>Save the resized image as a new file</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS?</h2>
        <p>Resizing photos using photo editing software instead of CSS is recommended because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Image quality: Resizing images using software preserves the original quality, whereas CSS resizing can lead to pixelation or blurriness.</li>
            <li>File size: Resized images using software can be optimized for web, reducing file size and improving page load times.</li>
            <li>Page performance: Resizing images using CSS can slow down page loading, as the browser needs to resize the image on the fly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By resizing images using photo editing software, you can ensure better image quality, smaller file sizes, and improved page performance.</p>
