    <h1>Kailani Tupou</h1>
    <p>- I was born in the Island of Samoa and then my dad had to move back to Tonga. So my whole life was in Tonga but luckily I can learn ans speak both languages of my father and my mother. I lost my mother when I was 10 years of age and then my father left me with my older sister and my younger brother to struggle in life. But luckily we able to manage everything and become independent so we may be strong enough to fight for a better future.</p>
    <p>- Well, living in the island was only two things that you looked at for your future. You either become smart at school or become a best in sports or other activity. So I've tried both of it and now I end up here at BYUH to further my education. Also, I'm interesting in my majors. Becoming a professional in IT also CS is a key to a future. I've loved to work with computers and other technology so I can be familiar with it so it can be easier for me understand it and also help me with my education.</p>
