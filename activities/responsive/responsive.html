        <h3>Why is the viewport meta tag important?</h3>
        <p>The viewport meta tag is crucial in modern web development, particularly for responsive web design. It allows you to control the layout and scaling of your web page on different devices, ensuring it looks good on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.</p>
        <h3>Why do we need a viewport meta tag?</h3>
        <p>The viewport meta tag is essential for responsive web design. It helps control the layout on mobile browsers by telling the browser how to adjust the page's dimensions and scaling. Without it, your web page might not display properly on different devices.</p>
        <h3>How can you adjust the CSS for printing?</h3>
        <p>Adjusting CSS for printing involves creating specific styles that optimize the web page for print format. This is typically done using the media print rule in your CSS file.</p>
        <h3>When would you want to adjust the CSS for printing?</h3>
        <p>You'd want to adjust the CSS for printing in situations where users need to print web pages (e.g., articles, receipts, reports) to provide a cleaner, more readable print layout, removing unnecessary elements like navigation bars, ads, and background images, and ensuring the printed version maintains the brand's visual consistency while being easy to read on paper.</p>
        <h3>When you select the same tag twice, and in one of them you say "flex-direction: column;" and the other says "flex-direction: row;", which one takes priority?</h3>
        <p>When you have conflicting CSS properties for the same element, the one that appears last in your stylesheet will take priority.</p>
        <h3>How do you change the CSS for a web page displayed on a phone?</h3>
        <p>To change the CSS for a web page displayed on a phone, you can use media queries. Media queries allow you to apply specific styles based on the device's characteristics, such as its width.</p>
