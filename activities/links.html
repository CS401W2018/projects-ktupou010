        <h1>Links</h1>
        <h3>Absolute Link:</h3>
        <a href="https://www.byuh.edu/admissions-aid">BYUH Homepage</a>
        <h3>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</h3>
        <p>An absolute link is a complete URL that includes the protocol (http/https), domain name, and path to the resource. A relative link is a URL that is relative to the current document or website, and does not include the protocol or domain name.</p>
        <p>Relative links are useful when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You're linking to another page within the same website.</li>
            <li>You want to make it easy to move your website to a different domain or server.</li>
            <li>You want to reduce the size of your HTML code.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Relative Link:</h3>

        <h3>List the 3 rules with relative links:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Same directory: Use the filename only (e.g., example.html).</li>
            <li>Subdirectory: Use the subdirectory name and filename (e.g., subdirectory/example.html).</li>
            <li>Parent directory: Use ../ to go up one level (e.g., ../example.html).</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Project</h3>

        <h3>Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</h3>
        <p>No, links do not always need to be inside a NAV tag. Links can be used anywhere in an HTML document, and can be wrapped in various elements such as P, DIV, SPAN, or A. The NAV tag is specifically used for navigation menus.</p>
