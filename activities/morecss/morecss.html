        <h3>What is the difference between block tags and inline tags?</h3>
        <p>Block tags and inline tags are fundamental concepts in HTML. Block tags, such as div, p, and h1, occupy the full width available, starting on a new line, and stack vertically. This makes them ideal for creating structural elements in a webpage. In contrast, inline tags, like span, a, and strong, only take up as much width as necessary and do not start on a new line, allowing them to sit alongside other inline elements horizontally within a block-level element.</p>
        <h3>What is the margin, border, and padding?</h3>
        <p>The margin, border, and padding are essential aspects of the CSS box model. The margin is the space outside the element's border, creating separation from other elements. The border surrounds the padding and content of an element, and it can have various styles, widths, and colors. Padding is the space between the element's content and its border, providing inner spacing within the element. Together, these properties control the layout and appearance of elements on a webpage.</p>
        <h3>What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?</h3>
        <p>CSS offers several units of measurement to define element sizes and spacing, including both absolute and relative units. Absolute units such as px (pixels), in (inches), cm (centimeters), mm (millimeters), pt (points), and pc (picas) provide fixed sizes. Relative units like em (relative to the font-size of the element), rem (relative to the font-size of the root element), % (percentage, relative to the parent element), vw (viewport width), vh (viewport height), vmin, and vmax (minimum and maximum of viewport's width and height, respectively) offer more flexible sizing options that adapt to different contexts.</p>
        <h3>When would you use a figure tag?</h3>
        <p>The figure tag is used to wrap self-contained content such as images, illustrations, diagrams, or other media, often accompanied by a figcaption for captions or descriptions. This tag is particularly useful for content that is separate from the main flow of the document and can be positioned or moved independently, enhancing semantic structure and accessibility in HTML.</p>
