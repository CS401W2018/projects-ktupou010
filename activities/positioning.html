        <h3>What is normal flow in HTML?</h3>
        <p>Normal flow is the way that elements are laid out on a web page by default. Block-level elements (like div, p, etc.) stack vertically from top to bottom, and inline elements (like span, a, etc.) are placed next to each other horizontally.</p>
        <h3>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h3>
        <p>Float is a CSS property used to place an element to the left or right of its container, allowing other elements to wrap around it. Common uses include text wrapping around images. Clearing the float is necessary because floated elements are removed from the normal flow, which can affect the layout of surrounding elements. To ensure that elements after the floated element are not affected, you use the clear property.</p>
        <h3>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Absolute positioning: An element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an element with a position other than static). If there is no such ancestor, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block.</li>
            <li>Fixed positioning: An element is positioned relative to the browser window and remains in that position even when the page is scrolled.</li>
            <li>Relative positioning: An element is positioned relative to its normal position in the flow of the document. You can use the top, right, bottom, and left properties to adjust its position without removing it from the flow.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</h3>
        <p>To create nice navigation buttons for mobile devices, you can use CSS to make them responsive and touch-friendly. Here are some tips:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a flexible grid layout (using flexbox or grid).</li>
            <li>Ensure buttons are large enough to be tapped easily.</li>
            <li>Use media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.</li>
            <li>Add padding and margin for spacing.</li>
            <li>Use icons and clear text labels.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</h3>
        <p>You have to go to your canvas, click on your Courses and then click on the tab "Pages" then click on the lecture noters you want to see and there you find the videos.</p>
