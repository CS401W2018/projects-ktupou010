        <h1>What is the difference between an ID and a Class?</h1>
        <p>In HTML and CSS, the main difference between an ID and a Class is their uniqueness and multiplicity. An ID is a unique identifier for a single element, whereas a Class can be applied to multiple elements that share a common characteristic or style. While an element can have only one ID, it can have multiple Classes. IDs are typically used to identify a specific element for styling, linking, or JavaScript manipulation, whereas Classes are used to group elements together for styling or manipulation.</p>
        <div>
            <h1>What is the difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag?</h1>
            <p id="secondpar">The main difference between a <span class="bolder">SPAN </span>tag and a DIV tag lies in their display type and purpose. A SPAN tag is an inline element, meaning it doesn't start a new line and only takes up the space needed for its content, making it ideal for grouping inline elements like text or images. In contrast, a DIV tag is a block-level element, starting a new line and taking up the full width available, making it suitable for grouping block-level elements like paragraphs, images, or other DIVs.</p>
        </div>
        <h1>What is the difference between a DIV tag and a HEADER, MAIN, or FOOTER?</h1>
        <p>The main difference between a DIV tag and a HEADER, MAIN, or FOOTER tag lies in their semantic meaning and purpose. A DIV tag is a generic container element that doesn't provide any specific meaning about its content, primarily used for styling and layout purposes. In contrast, HEADER, MAIN, and FOOTER tags are semantic elements that provide specific meaning about their content, such as introductory content, primary content, and supplementary information, respectively. Using these semantic elements instead of DIV tags improves accessibility, enhances search engine optimization (SEO), and results in cleaner and more maintainable code.</p>
        <h1>What are the different ways to select a color?</h1>
        <p class="blue bigger">There are several ways to select a color:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Hex Code: A six-digit code consisting of letters and numbers that represent the red, green, and blue (RGB) values of the color.</li>
            <li>RGB Values: Specifying the red, green, and blue values of the color, ranging from 0 to 255.</li>
            <li>HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) Values: Specifying the hue, saturation, and lightness of the color.</li>
            <li>Color Name: Using a predefined color name, such as "red," "blue," or "green."</li>
            <li>Color Picker: Using a visual color picker tool to select a color from a palette or spectrum.</li>
            <li>RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) Values: Specifying the red, green, blue, and alpha (transparency) values of the color.</li>
            <li>HEXA with Alpha: Specifying the hex code with an additional alpha value for transparency.</li>
