        <p>Welcome to Tonga, a bustling island nation in the South Pacific, where every day is a happy occasion. Tonga is a beautiful and unique country in the South Pacific, comprised of over 170 islands, of which only 36 are inhabited. Known for its stunning beaches, vibrant culture, and warm hospitality. Tonga is the only remaining monarchy in the Pacific, with King Tupou VI as its current ruler and it's one of the few countries with a rich and unique cultural heritage that has never been colonized. Tonga is home to some of the world’s most impressive and well-preserved megalithic structures, including the Haamonga a Maui trilithon, it is known for its traditional dances, including the Mauluulu and the Tauolunga, a popular destination for whale watching, with humpback whales visiting the waters around the islands and it is also known for its production of kava, a traditional drink made from the kava plant’s roots.</p>
