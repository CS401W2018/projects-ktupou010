        <p>‘Eua is the Kingdom’s oldest island, covered with hills and lush rainforest. Look forward to the Kingdom’s best hiking with well-marked trails criss-crossing the pristine ‘Eua National Park.

            Experience the spectacular cliffs, caves and sinkholes of northern ‘Eua or venture to the rocky southern coastline. Watch sea birds soaring atop the thermal currents swirling around ‘Eua’s dramatic cliffs or descend through lush rainforest to the ocean below. Keep an ear open for the call of the Koki, ‘Eua’s rare red-breasted shining parrot.
            
            Markedly larger wildlife includes visiting Humpback whales from June to November, often cruising remarkably close to ‘Eua’s rocky shoreline. For divers, ‘Eua’s most spectacular highlight is one of the Pacific’s largest underwater caverns. It is naturally, illuminating a huge amphitheatre at a depth of almost 30 metres.</p>
